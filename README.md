# Confucius [![Build Status][badge]][build]

A Clojure library for composable and declarative configuration.

Suggestions on api, bugfixes, feature request, etc are all very welcome!

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/confucius.svg)](https://clojars.org/confucius)


# Rationale

Applications that require configuration should read values from the
environment they live in (see [12factor][12factor]). Unfortunately this may
clutter the application with `(Sytem/getenv)` calls that return un-typed data.
Having all the configuration related data in one handy map that can read properties
from the environment and provide sensible default values wherever possible should
be the the way to go. This makes it easy to add configuration to version control too!

`confucius` aims at solving exactly these problems. It builds on some of the
ideas from other libraries such as [immuconf][immuconf] (composability),
[nomad][nomad], or [environ][environ].


# Is it used in production?

YES! It's been used in production since late 2015!


# Quick Start

The code below show how to use confucius. The files `awesome-service.yml`,
`host.edn`, `subsys.json` follow the example.

```clojure
(ns my.amazing.ns
 (:require
  [confucius.core  :as c]

  ;; If you want support for json and/or yaml you'll need to add
  ;; clojure.data.json or snakeyaml (or both) to your dependencies.
  ;;[confucius.ext.yaml]
  ;;[confucius.ext.json]
  [confucius.ext.all] ; this requires both

  [clojure.java.io :as io]))

(c/load-config
 ;; Why not calling prismatic's schema for validation & complex
 ;; coercion in postprocess?
 {:postprocess-fn identity} ; optional
 [{:global {:tmp-dir "${tmp.dir:/tmp}"}}
  (io/resource "awesome-service.yml")
  "host.edn"])

;; => {:global
;;      {:tmp-dir "/tmp"}
;;
;;     :http
;;      {:bind-address "0.0.0.0"
;;       :port 8080}
;;
;;      :audit-log-dir
;;      "/var/log/service/audit"  ;; assuming ${log-dir} was set to
;;                                ;; `/var/log` in the native environment
;;
;;      :subsys
;;      {:id "subsys1"}}
```

File contents:

```yaml
# file: awesome-service.yml (on classpath)
http:
  bind-address: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 80

# Include configuration from `sub-system.json`.
# Supports relative file urls.
subsys: "@:file://./subsys.json"

# Reference (in that order) either
# another value in the configuration,
# a java system property or the native
# enrivonment. Uses `get-in` split at
# `.` to resolve value within the configuration
# map, the value as is for java system
# properties and uppercaseing with `. -> _`
# replacement for native env lookups.
audit-log: "${log-dir}/service/audit"
```

```json
# file: subsys.json (file system)
{ "id" : "subsys1" }
```

```edn
# file: host.edn
{:http {:port 8080}}
```

`confucius.example_test.clj`

See `confucius.cli` for an example how to integrate
command line argument parsing.

# TODO

* support printing of configuration map
* warn/log when config properties are being overwritten by
  other files. use metadata to show where the value came from?
